MATLAB code for Metabolic Economics
===================================

[Metabolic economics](https://www.metabolic-economics.de/) is a theory optimal metabolic behaviour in cells. Complementing existing approaches for modelling cell metabolism, it employs a notion of "economic value" to characterize the importance of individual metablites, fluxes, and enzyme (for example, their impact on the achievable rate of biomass production).

This repository contains Matlab functions to compute and analyse metabolic values, extending the [Metabolic Network Toolbox](https://github.com/liebermeister/metabolic-network-toolbox)
